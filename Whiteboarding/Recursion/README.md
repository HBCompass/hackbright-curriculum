Whiteboarding Practice: Recursion
=================================

Introduction
------------

Remember when you used to point a video camera at the screen that was displaying 
the video feed, or tried to put two mirrors face-to-face and peer into infinity? 
Yeah, recursion is kind of like that.

Take the following function:

```
def func_a():
    print "Function a is the haps right now."
    func_b()
```

So far, nothing out of the ordinary. It is perfectly permissible to call func_b
from func_a. But, in an M. Night Shyamalan-worthy twist, look at the definition 
of func_b --

```
def func_b():
    print "FUNCTION B IN THE HIZOUSE."
    func_a()
```

Uh-oh.

Running this beastly combination of functions together produces the following output 
(assuming we start from func_a)

```
Function a is the haps right now.
FUNCTION B IN THE HIZOUSE.
Function a is the haps right now.
FUNCTION B IN THE HIZOUSE.
Function a is the haps right now.
FUNCTION B IN THE HIZOUSE.
Function a is the haps right now.
FUNCTION B IN THE HIZOUSE.
Function a is the haps right now.
FUNCTION B IN THE HIZOUSE.
```
... forever.

Actually, eventually the computer explodes in a fiery blaze. Better stop your program.

Let's take the idea one step further. If func_a can call func_b which just ends up 
calling func_a, what happens if we eliminate the middle man?

```
def func_c():
    print "OH MY GOD I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING"
    func_c()
```

This is a recursive call. Any function that calls itself is said to be
recursive. For the full definition of recursion, look up recursion in a
dictionary, but the important part here is that the function calls itself.
While you were busy panicking, trying to stop the computer from exploding, you
may have noticed that a side effect of recursion is that it causes a chunk of
code to repeat. As it stands, func_c is effectively an infinite loop. With
slight changes, we can harness the power of recursion for evil. I mean good. We
can harness it for good. I mean loops.

Consider the following scenario. I have two functions, func_d, and func_e.

```
def func_d():
    func_e()
    print "I'm done."

def func_e():
    print "Sup." 
```

Neither function is recursive. At this point, it's helpful to imagine that the
call to func_e is _nested_ inside func_d. If we call func_d, the text "I'm
done" won't print until after func_e has been called and completed. The same
idea applies to our recursive function:

```
def func_c():
    print "OH MY GOD I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING"
    func_c()
```

If we call func_c, it won't complete until after it calls and completes..
func_c, which never completes until it calls func_c and.. arrrrgh. Func_c is
nested inside func_c which is nested inside func_c and it never stops. Okay,
let's try a different tack. What if we randomly forced func_c to end?

```
def func_c():
    if random.choice([True, False]):
        return
    print "OH MY GOD I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING"
    func_c()
```

In this case, each call to func_c might randomly end, allowing the enclosing
call to func_c to end, allowing the enclosing one to end, until we finally
reach the outer enclosure. Now we're getting somewhere. Let's make one more
change. Instead of randomly ending, let's control when we end. In this case,
we'll end when the argument to func_c is 0.

```
def func_c(n):
    if n == 0:
        return
    print "OH MY GOD I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING"
    func_c(n)
```

So now func_c takes an argument, n. And if n is 0, it stops. If it's not 0, it
repeats. So far, things are still not better. We have some control, the
function either repeats forever, or doesn't. Let's look at the last line. If
the function repeats while n is 0, what if, when we called func_c, we inched n
towards 0, like so.

```
def func_c(n):
    if n == 0:
        return
    print n
    func_c(n-1)
```

If you run this, you'll find that this function counts down from n to 1,
printing each number, then stopping. This is a (semi) useful recursive
function. Without looping, we can repeat a piece of code and we can control
how many times it repeats. There are three rules to writing a recursive
function:

1. The recursive function must have a base case where it decides to end, here,
   it's when n reaches 0.

2. The function must accept some argument that can be moved _towards_ the base
   case, here, it's our argument n.

3. The function must call itself. This happens on the last line.

One note about base cases, consider the base case to be the most degenerate
input your function can take and still be considered to do it's job. If your
function is going to print the numbers from n to 0, the simplest version of
that is to just print 0. If your function manipulates a list or a string in
some way, say, to count the length, the easiest length string to count is 0.

Description
-----------

In recursion.py, you'll find a number of functions that should be solved
using recursion. Each function has a description and some test examples
so you can see what the expected output should be for your function.

Edit this file to file in the body of each function. When you'd like to
test your work, run the script:

```
$ python recursion.py
```

If there are errors or failed tests, they will print out.

When you have passed all of the tests, it will print a message congratulating
you.
